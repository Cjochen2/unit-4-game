# unit-4-game

This is a basic number counting game. The idea is to guess the randomnly generated number by clicking the four pictures at the bottom. The pictures are each assigned a random value that you need to figure out and then add up to match the number. If you go over the number the game will reset and a "You Lost" message will pop up above your current wins/losses. If you win the same will happen except with a "You Win" message. The game tracks wins, losses and the number of clicks it takes you to get each number.
